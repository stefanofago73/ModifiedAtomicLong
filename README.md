## Modified Atomic Long ##


### Description ###

This a simple and, in someway raw, code to create<br/>
an alternative version of AtomicLong using two techniques<br/> 
padding and fixed backoff.<br/>
What we obtain is a more effective AtomicLong that behave<br/>
exactly like the original one but perform better.<br/>
